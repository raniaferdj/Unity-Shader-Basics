# Unity-Shader-Basics

This project is based on the [Unity Basics Tutorials](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/basics/) from Catlike Coding. The tutorials provide an introduction to working with C# and shader programming for Unity 3D.

## Tutorials Implemented
Here's a glimpse of what I've covered so far:


### 1. Building a Graph

In this tutorial phase, we delve into the fundamentals of graph visualization and mathematical function representation. Key objectives include:

- Constructing a visually appealing graph to depict mathematical functions.
- Utilizing prefabs and instantiating multiple cubes for graphical representation.
- Implementing surface shaders and shader graphs for enhanced visual effects.
- Adding animation to bring the graph to life.

### 2. Mathematical Surfaces

Moving forward, we explore the intricacies of displaying mathematical surfaces within Unity. This phase encompasses:

- Creating a comprehensive function library for efficient code organization.
- Leveraging delegates and enumeration types to enhance functionality.
- Displaying 2D functions on a grid for visualization purposes.
- Defining and rendering complex surfaces in a 3D environment
